<body><strong><u>OpenConCam 2016</u></strong><br><br>OpenCon 2016 is the student and early career academic professional conference on Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data being held in Washington, DC.<br><br>The <strong>OpenCon 2016 Cambridge</strong> satellite event will bring together students, early career academic professionals and open advocates from around Cambridge (although anyone from the surrounding areas are welcome to join us!)<br><br>This year&#x27;s theme is <strong><em>Building Impact Through Openness</em></strong>.<br><br>Our goal is to support and build the open community in Cambridge. We want to empower attendees to <strong>make a difference</strong> in their respective fields through open research, data, education and access.<br><br>This year&#x27;s committee have brought together a sensational program of world leading speakers but there is also time scheduled for focus group discussion around actions that we can take to make a change in the world.<br><br>Furthermore there&#x27;s ample time set aside in the day to ensure all the attendees will be able to share their ongoing activities (in the &quot;silent&quot; unconference) and hopefully build new collaborations for the future.<br><br>You can follow the main OpenCon event in held in Washington DC #OpenCon, and you can join the discussion around the Cambridge satellite event at #OpenConCam.<br><br>We look forward to seeing you there!

It&#x27;s complex.&nbsp; The whole publishing process is new to ECRs, licensing is new,<strong> there&#x27;s a lot of pressure</strong> to publish and apply for grants and teach and ...<strong> and it&#x27;s not clear what to do,</strong> how to publish, what&#x27;s the process.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Would it be useful to have research into what personal pressures that stop people being open?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li><li>wrong is a worry. easy for senior academics to publish rejection lists. hard if you have nothing, yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>mid career researchers sharing failure is encouraging, when they don&#x27;t have tenure.&nbsp;<strong> good role model - realistic aspiration</strong></li><li>different chalenges in different disciplines. monograph vs coauthored reports and papers...&nbsp; different nuance even in close fields, eg CS where conference papers and debate of work in progress is useful, vs engineering where you present a final polished work.&nbsp; Your research process likely follows what your early PI tells you. you might not get any training in your first few months as a phd (example).&nbsp; or you get &quot;this is how to add to the repo&quot; but not explain why</li><li>humanities - 3yrs work before it goes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>are we making a huge assumption that people understand why the system is as it is?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Lab vs field culture.&nbsp; changes over time.&nbsp; Now, put whole genomics stuff in public repo; even 5y ago this wasn&#x27;tt the case, data is lost.
