8 June 2016 Improving the research process - discussing an 'open research' position
[Eventbrite signup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/improving-the-research-process-discussing-an-open-research-position-tickets-25391407383)

How can we ensure that researchers are rewarded for the quality of their research and not only for the impact factor of the journals in which they publish? What needs to happen so the quality of the whole research process is taken into account when considering recruitment or academic promotions?Could our University have a position to encourage better transparency and openness in research? Could this solve some of the current problems experienced in the academic sector?
The Office of Scholarly Communication would like to consult researchers on a number of ideas geared towards helping researchers to make all of their work openly available and rewarding the quality of the whole research process. We count on YOU to tell us what current problems in academic research are and what ideas would be useful to include in a planning document. Everyone is welcome to come to this event and contribute their ideas.

8-15 June 2016 Open Technology Week
[More information and booking](http://www.synbio.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/Open_Technology_Week)

Open Technology Week will take place across the city between 8-15 June 2016, culminating in a gathering and open source maker faire at the Cambridge University Engineering Department on 15 June. We will showcase and celebrate open and open source technologies developed across Cambridge and beyond. We'll be asking why open matters, who benefits and in what contexts does greater openness make sense across a diverse array of established and emerging areas from synthetic biology to additive manufacturing to big data analytics. All welcome!
